Hello everyone! My name is Israel, I'm 21 from Columbus, Ohio.
    if you need to reach me: izzyryan603@yahoo.com

I recently finished a full-stack development bootcamp - Tech Elevator!
I learned the following: <br>
    Back-end: Java <br>
    Database: postgreSQL <br>
    Front-end: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Vue.js <br>

Currently I'm learning / Working on :
    C++ -> aligns closer to what I'd like to do in my career
    Competitive Programming -> I think it'd be a fun side hobby!
    MTG website -> finishing up and polishing my final capstone into a better representation of my skills and abilities    

Fun fact about me: My rubik's cube personal best solve is 13.5 seconds
